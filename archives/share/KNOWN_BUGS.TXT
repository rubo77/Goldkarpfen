#V0.12

version <208 :
  (no bug - feature update)
  server.dat format has changed with activation of diff-patch-mode (227+)
  solution : update to latest version and sync-all ([r][A]) again after restart

version 226 :
  (uncritical)
  update will result in double VERSION file
  solution : remove older VERSION file and update to 227+
  (fixed in 227+)

version 227-234 :
  (medium critical)
  if a tarball is in archives but the stream is not in the sane list, a diff-patch download would quarantine the archive (and block further downloads)
  solution 1:update to 235+ ; exit ; remove all old files : rm archives/alias-_key_addr_.itp.tar.gz* ;
             move quarantined tarball into archives ; restart ; sync-all ([r][A]) again
  solution 2: update to 237+ ; use [m]-qurantine and move it into archives
  (fixed in 235+)

version 233-235 :
  (uncritical)
  old diffs from others get not deleted
  solution : update to 236 ; old diffs will be deleted automatically, if a new diff comes in
    if not : exit GK ; delete the older ones (for each archive) manually ; restart
    (for the lazy : it is safe to delete all diff-files : exit GK ; rm archives/*.itp.tar.gz_D* ; restart)
  (fixed in 236+)

version 238-239
  (medium critical)
  update-archive-date.sh will exit and not update server.dat if archives/ is empty
  solution : update to 241+
  (fixed in 241+)

version 241
  (medium critical)
  update-archive-date.sh works not over remote ssh call
  solution : update to 242+
  (fixed in 242+)

version 241-242
  (uncritical)
  SIGINT exit check cannot be abortet when ctrl-c was pressed in a sub-script
  solution : update to 243+
  (fixed in 243+)

version 233-245
  (uncritical)
  gapped diff will be quarantined with a overly dramatic error message
  solution : update to 245+ (NOTE: it is safe to remove all quarantined GARBAGE_diffs : rm quarantine/GARBAGE_*_D*)
  (fixed in 245+)

version <251
  (critical)
  check-dates around new year with <=9 days difference produces error - blocks updates up to 9 days into the new year
  solution : update to 251+ (update may be blocked until 01.09)
  (fixed in 251+)

version ?-253
  (fatal)
  code name : OCTAL_SPLIT
  arithmetic error in check-dates makes updates impossible on day_of_year that contain a "8" or "9" (e.g Jan.08, Jan.19 ...)
  and all archives get moved to quarantine/old-archives

  details : day_of_the year generated by "date +%j" adds prefix zeros if below 100 (e.g. "00x")
            zero-prefixed numbers get interpretet as octal in the arithmetics of POSIX-SHELL and produce an error if a 8 or 9 occurs
            if the date of the year contains a 8 or 9 and is below 100 (e.g. 008, 018, 039...) the archives-date-test fails

  solution1 : try to update 3 days in a row ([r][A], [r][U] on success), as updates will work if day_of_year does not contain a 8 or 9
  solution2 : get the latest Goldkarpfen :

curl -f --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 http://rlnh2w5zjagfcbrf2kfazi3obl7agtd4g7flgpsvqaxnjrgbrihmsxyd.onion/Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz -o Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz

              or :

curl -f --proxy localhost:4444 http://6f5bmqtipvz7wdurqx7ireer3j47wegaztivl5pnsiumk5jeurua.b32.i2p/Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz -o Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz

              mv Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz update/
              cd update/
              tar -xvf Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz
              cp Goldkarpfen/update/sync_runtime_files.sh .
              ./sync_runtime_files.sh
              rm Goldkarpfen-latest.tar.gz

  solution3 : edit check-date.sh and add as the first non-comment-line :
              exit 0
              (start Goldkarpfen after that and update with [r][U)

  after fix : re-download all archives with [r][A] and archive your itp-stream with [a] ; on success delete quarantine/old-archives/*
  (fixed in 253+)

version <269
  (annoying)
  url1 qrcode has a "=" before the url
  solution : update to 270
  (fixed in 270+)

gki.sh 0.37
  (fatal)
  installer does not work if EDITOR var is not set
  solution : export editor=nano manually before install / use gki.sh 0.38
  (fixed in gki.sh 0.38)

gki.sh 0.38
  (confusing)
  installer reports "ag not found"
  solution : installer works anyway
  (fixed in gki.sh 0.39)

version <283
  (migration issue/uncritical)
  new patch files (xdelta3) will produce GARBAGE files
  solution : update to 283+ ; remove GARBAGE files
  (fixed in 283+)

version ?-323
  (can be confusing up to critical)
  check-dependencies does not exit on $EDITOR or fzy/fzf missing
  solution : update to 324
  (fixed in 324+)
