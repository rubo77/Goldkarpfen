#V0.4

version <208 :
  (no bug - feature update)
  server.dat format has changed with activation of diff-patch-mode (227+)
  solution : update to latest version and sync-all ([r][A]) again after restart

version 226 :
  (uncritical)
  update will result in double VERSION file
  solution : remove older VERSION file and update to 227+
  (fixed in 227+)

version 227-234 :
  (medium critical)
  if a tarball is in archives but the stream is not in the sane list, a diff-patch download would quarantine the archive (and block further downloads)
  solution 1:update to 235+ ; exit ; remove all old files : rm archives/alias-_key_addr_.itp.tar.gz* ;
             move quarantined tarball into archives ; restart ; sync-all ([r][A]) again
  solution 2: update to 237+ ; use [m]-qurantine and move it into archives
  (fixed in 235+)

version 233-235 :
  (uncritical)
  old diffs from others get not deleted
  solution : update to 236 ; old diffs will be deleted automatically, if a new diff comes in
    if not : exit GK ; delete the older ones (for each archive) manually ; restart
    (for the lazy : it is safe to delete all diff-files : exit GK ; rm archives/*.itp.tar.gz_D* ; restart)
  (fixed in 236+)

  (medium critical)
  update-archive-date.sh will exit and not update server.dat if archives/ is empty
