HOW TO MIGRATE:
Stop Goldkarpfen; open a terminal an go into your Goldkarpfen folder

  cd itp-files
  cp $OWN_ALIAS-$T_BUF1.itp $OWN_ALIAS-$T_BUF2.itp
  sha512sum $OWN_ALIAS-$T_BUF2.itp > $OWN_ALIAS-$T_BUF2.itp.sha512sum
  cd ..
  ./sign.sh itp-files/$OWN_ALIAS-$T_BUF2.sha512sum

Start Goldkarpfen and edit [!] your old itp-file and remove all posts and comments; after that add a post with: "delete this itp-channel and blacklist it."
Stop Goldkarpfen and edit your Goldkarpfen.config and change the second line to: $OWN_ALIAS-$T_BUF2.itp

If you are using tor: rename your tor-service dir

  sudo mv /var/lib/tor/$T_BUF1 /var/lib/tor/$T_BUF2

Start Goldkarpfen and archive your new itp-stream and donâ€™t forget to adapt your aliases.
Seed your 'marked-for-deletion-stream' for some time and then delete it.
